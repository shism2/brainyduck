# with user-defined-functions example

This example contains:

- a User-Defined Function (UDF) with simplified definition [sayHi.udf]
- a User-Defined Function (UDF) with extended definition [sayHello.udf]
- a User-Defined Role (UDR) [publicAccess.role]
- a Graphql schema [Schema.graphql]
- a Graphql operations document [queries.gql]

By running `npx faugra -e <MY_FAUNA_SECRET>` you should expect to see:

- The UDF and UDR uploaded to the cloud
- a requests sdk containing all the operations, fully typed and with auto-complete support [accessible through `import sdk from 'faugra'`]

Once faugra has been setup, you can run `FAUGRA_SECRET=<MY_FAUNA_SECRET> npm start` to execute the operations demonstration [index.ts].
