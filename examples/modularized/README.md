# Modularized example

This example contains:

- multiple graphql schemas and User-Defined Function (UDF) spread in 2 different folders
- a root graphql schema containing the Query type

By running `npx faugra -e <MY_FAUNA_SECRET>` you should expect to see:

- all UDF uploaded to the cloud
- a requests sdk containing all the operations, fully typed and with auto-complete support [accessible through `import sdk from 'faugra'`]

Once faugra has been setup, you can run `FAUGRA_SECRET=<MY_FAUNA_SECRET> npm start` to execute the operations demonstration [index.ts].
